# Optimization for Data Science – Homework Project

This repository contains a homework project for the "Optimization for Data Science" course at the University of Padua, developed by Dumitru Movila and collaborators.

## Project Summary

The goal of this assignment is to explore and implement different optimization strategies applied to a semi-supervised learning setting, combining theoretical understanding with practical experimentation in Python.

## Topics Covered

- **Gradient Descent** (fixed step size, Lipschitz-based, and Armijo rule)
- **Block Coordinate Gradient Descent** (Gauss–Southwell rule)
- **Coordinate Minimization**
- **Thresholding and classification**
- **Similarity-based label propagation**
- **Application to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**

## Results

The algorithms were tested on both synthetic data and real-world data (Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset). Comparative analysis highlights trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and computational efficiency for each method.
